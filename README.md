All CRUD API's of the contacts are implemented there.
In this part of the application we can use the contacts API and then we can manage the contact based on the user.
We also have a registered user, a logged in user, and once a user is logged in, he can create, update, delete and read all the contacts that he have created;
We can have multiple users and they can manage their own contacts.
